## why plu-ts?

there is the need for decentralized applications, however the tools to build a [**truly** decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) application are missing or limited to server side compilation.

## what is plu-ts?

```plu-ts``` wants to be a library to allow Cardano-related software to be written entirely in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), in support for a wider developer ecosystem adoption and easier integration.

the project will be composed mainly of two parts: on-chain and off-chain;

the on-chain part will take care of smart contracts creation
the off-chain one will allow for transaction creation (so will take care of smart contracts interaction, among all the off-chain stuff)

## Get Started

Documentation is currently being written feel free to contribute to the [`plu-ts-docs` repository](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plut-ts-docs)

Or you can start playing with `plu-ts` by running the following command in your project root directory
```
npm install https://github.com/Harmonic-Laboratories/plu-ts
```

## Project Catalyst

a collection of all proposals made in the past is in the [```catalyst-proposals.md```](./catalyst-proposals.md) file
