# plu-ts
Write Cardano-related, on-chain and off-chain code, entirely in Typescript 

## why plu-ts?

there is the need for decentralized applications, however the tools to built a [**truly** decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) application are missing or limited to static compilation

```plu-ts``` wants to be a library to allow Cardano-related software to be written entirely in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), allowing a wider developer ecosystem to code both:
 - applications backands running on [nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/) or [deno](https://deno.land/)
 - dApps with smart-contracts created _on-the-fly_, **client-side**

  - [on-chain/readme.md](./docs//why-plu-ts/on-chain/readme.md)

there are a few proposals to speed up the development of this repository:
- [Typescript smart-contracts]() link will be updated as soon the proposal is written
- [100% Typescript offchain code]() link will be updated as soon the proposal is written

old proposals:

- Found 8:
  - [(passed, not founded) F8 proposal for an Offchain Typescript library](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396949)

## timeline

both the timelines for on-chain and off-chain development are specified in the respecive [docs/why-plu-ts folder](./docs/why-plu-ts/)

- [on-chain implementation ideal timeline](./docs/why-plu-ts/on-chain/timeline.md)
- [off-chain implementation ideal timeline](./docs/why-plu-ts/off-chain/timeline.md)
