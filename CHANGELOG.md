# Changelog

## Unreleased 0.1.1

- UtilityTerms should expose typescript functions rather than plu-ts ones; this was done to incentivize developers to reuse the terms but it extremly hurts readability
- UtilityTerms will still expose the plu-ts term equivalent of each method trough the `<method name>Term` property
